This the McDowell's Eat the Burger App!

They have the Big Mac and we have the Big Mic.
They have a sesame seed bun, our buns have no seeds. 

You are able to eat burgers from a list and after you devour them, there is
a list of burgers you devoured. If you do not see a burger you like, you can 
create a burger. Mcdowell's builds a database so you can see a history of the 
burgers you have created and eaten.
